## Overview

Traditional battery testers rely on complex hardware — multiple current sources, precision amplifiers, dedicated fuel gauge ICs. This project flips the paradigm: **minimize the hardware, maximize the software intelligence**.

The VRA Meter uses **Voltage Relaxation Analysis** — a technique similar to approaches used or researched in advanced BMS for electric vehicles — to extract three critical battery health parameters from a single 200ms current pulse:

| Parameter | What It Measures | Equivalent To |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **R_ohm** | Instantaneous voltage jump on load disconnect | AC-IR at 1 kHz |
| **R_pol** | Slow voltage recovery after load removal | Diffusion/polarization resistance |
| **R²** | How well the relaxation curve fits a logarithmic model | Structural integrity of electrodes & electrolyte |

The entire measurement takes under 400ms and requires no user expertise — the firmware automatically grades the battery as **EXCELLENT**, **GOOD**, or **POOR**.

## How It Works

```
1. CONNECT BATTERY

         ▼
2. APPLY LOAD (200ms pulse)
   │  Measure: V_load, I_load
   │
   ▼
3. REMOVE LOAD
   │
   ├─ T=0ms:   Record V_instant immediately (ADS1115 integrates ~1.16ms,
   │            naturally filtering inductive ringing — no software delay)
   │
   ├─ T=10ms:  ─┐
   ├─ T=20ms:   │ Record 30 voltage samples
   ├─ T=30ms:   │ every 10ms over 300ms
   │  ...        │
   └─ T=300ms: ─┘
         │
         ▼
4. CALCULATE
   │  R_ohm  = (V_instant - V_load) / I_load
   │  R_pol  = (V_final - V_instant) / I_load
   │  R²     = log_regression_fit(ΔV vs ln(t))  [centered data]

5. OUTPUT RESULT + SOH GRADE
```

## Hardware

### Bill of Materials

| Component | Value | Package | Notes |
|-----------|-------|---------|-------|
| Arduino Nano/Uno | ATmega328P | DIP/TQFP | Or any AVR-based board |
| ADS1115 | 16-bit ADC | Breakout | 4-ch differential, I2C |
| MOSFET (N-ch) | IRLZ44N or similar | TO-220 | Logic-level gate |
| Shunt Resistor | 0.1 Ω, 1W | Axial | Current sense |
| Load Resistor | 10 Ω, 5W | Wirewound | Adjustable — see [Choosing Load Resistor](#choosing-load-resistor) |
| Battery Holder | — | — | For cell under test |
| Pull-up Resistors | 4.7 kΩ | 0805 | **External** pull-ups on SDA/SCL to 5V — REQUIRED for 200kHz I2C |
| **Pull-up Resistor** | **10 kΩ** | 0805 | **REQUIRED on MOSFET gate to 5V — keeps MOSFET OFF during Arduino boot** |

**Total component count: 7** (excluding Arduino and battery holder)

> **CRITICAL:** The 10kΩ pull-up resistor on the MOSFET gate to 5V is mandatory. During Arduino boot (first ~50ms), all pins are high-impedance INPUT. With active-low MOSFET logic (LOW=ON, HIGH=OFF), the gate must be pulled HIGH to keep the load OFF. A pull-down to GND would turn the load ON during boot — dangerous.

> **PLATFORM WARNING:** Pull-ups to 5V (SDA/SCL) are ONLY safe for 5V boards (Uno, Nano ATmega328P). For 3.3V boards (Due, Nano 33 BLE/IoT, Zero, RP2040), use pull-ups to 3.3V — NOT 5V.

### Kelvin Connection

For accurate voltage measurement, use **4-wire Kelvin sensing**:

- **Sense wires (thin):** Connect A2 (V+) and A3 (V-) directly to the battery terminals
- **Power wires (thick):** Connect through the shunt and load for current path
- Keep sense wires as short as possible and away from power traces

```

## Software Architecture

### Layer Diagram

```
VRA-meter/
├── VRA-meter.ino        UI layer: serial commands, print results, trigger measurement
├── config.h             User-tunable parameters (pins, timing, thresholds)
├── ads1115.h/.cpp       Driver layer: bit-banged I2C, register read/write, conversion control
└── vra.h/.cpp           Analysis layer: measurement phases, R² regression, SOH grading
```

**Dependency flow:** `.ino` → `vra.h` → `ads1115.h` → `config.h`

The `.ino` file should never access ADS1115 registers directly. All ADC operations go through `VRA_Analyzer` methods or `ADS1115` public API (`readDifferential`, `startConversion`, `readResult`).

### Measurement Phases

`VRA_Analyzer::measure()` orchestrates four distinct phases:

| Phase | Method | What It Does |
|-------|--------|-------------|
| 0 | `checkBattery()` | Read battery voltage, check I2C bus, validate safe range |
| 1 | `acquireData()` | Apply load pulse, capture V_instant, collect 30 relaxation samples |
| 2 | `calculateParams()` | Compute R_ohm and R_pol from voltage deltas and current |
| 3 | `gradeResult()` | Run logarithmic regression on centered data, assign SOH grade |

### Key Design Decisions

- **3-layer architecture** — `.ino` (UI) → `vra.cpp` (analysis) → `ads1115.cpp` (driver). Clean separation of concerns; each layer is independently testable
- **Direct-port bit-banged I2C** — ATmega328P PORTC manipulation (`sdaHigh()`, `sclLow()`) achieves ~200kHz clock, vs ~20kHz with `digitalWrite`. No Wire library, no interrupt conflicts
- **Single-shot mode** (860 SPS) — one conversion per read, no continuous streaming overhead
- **No external libraries** — pure Arduino core, zero `#include` beyond `<Arduino.h>` and `<math.h>`
- **Type-safe enums** — `VRA_Error` and `SOH_Grade` are strongly-typed enums (`enum : uint8_t`), not bare `#define` constants
- **PROGMEM log table** — pre-computed `ln(10)..ln(300)` in flash, avoiding 30 expensive `log()` calls on the FPU-less ATmega328P
- **Centered regression** — voltage data is centered (`ΔV = V[i] - V[0]`) before R² calculation to prevent catastrophic cancellation in 32-bit float
- **PGA ±6.144V for voltage channel** — 4.2V Li-ion full charge saturates ±4.096V range; ±6.144V gives 187.5µV/LSB which is sufficient for 10-150mV relaxation signals
- **Quantization guard** — if relaxation amplitude < 4mV (~21 LSB at 187.5µV/LSB), R² regression is skipped and battery is auto-marked EXCELLENT (signal too small to measure meaningfully)
- **Zero-delay V_instant** — no software delay after MOSFET off; the ADS1115's 1.16ms integration window naturally filters inductive ringing
- **Start-before-wait ADC timing** — conversion starts ~2ms before target read time, runs in parallel with the busy-wait, ensuring samples are precisely aligned to the 10ms grid
- **ADC saturation detection** — raw ADC code is checked against `ADC_SATURATION_THRESHOLD` (32700) before computing current; saturated readings produce `VRA_ERR_ADC_SATURATED` instead of wrong resistance values
- **I2C NACK detection** — every I2C write checks the ACK bit; NACK sets `last_i2c_error_` flag, propagated as `VRA_ERR_I2C_FAULT`
- **Safety timeout** — 2-second hard limit in `measure()`, kills MOSFET on any I2C hang
- **Pull-up (not pull-down) on MOSFET gate** — active-low logic (LOW=ON, HIGH=OFF) requires pull-UP to 5V; pull-down would turn load ON during Arduino boot (~50ms high-Z period)

| Any character | Run one measurement |
| `a` / `A` | Toggle auto-mode (continuous measurements every 1 second) |

### Auto Mode

In auto-mode, the device continuously measures and outputs results. This is useful for:
- Monitoring voltage drift over time
- Logging relaxation curves to a file
- Testing battery response to repeated pulses

## Measurement Science

### Voltage Relaxation Curve

When a lithium-ion battery delivers current and the load is suddenly removed, the terminal voltage does not recover instantly. Instead, it follows a characteristic two-phase recovery:

**Phase 1 — Ohmic Recovery (instantaneous):**
The voltage jumps by `I × R_ohm` the moment current stops. This reflects the purely resistive losses in the metal contacts, electrolyte, and separator.

**Phase 2 — Chemical Relaxation (logarithmic):**
The voltage continues to rise slowly as lithium ions diffuse back to equilibrium positions within the electrode crystal structure. This process follows `V(t) = A × ln(t) + B` where `t` is time after load removal.

Healthy batteries follow this logarithmic law precisely. Degraded batteries deviate from it.

### R_ohm — Ohmic Resistance

Calculated from the instantaneous voltage jump when load is disconnected:

```
R_ohm = (V_instant - V_load) / I_load
```

This is equivalent to the AC internal resistance measured at 1 kHz by professional impedance analyzers, but obtained with a simple DC pulse.

**Typical values for 18650 Li-ion cells:**
- New cell: 20–50 mΩ
- Aged cell: 50–150 mΩ
- Damaged cell: > 200 mΩ

### R_pol — Polarization Resistance

Calculated from the total voltage relaxation depth:

```
R_pol = (V_final - V_instant) / I_load
```

This represents the combined resistance of charge transfer at the electrode surfaces and solid-state diffusion of lithium ions. It is highly sensitive to:
- Electrolyte decomposition
- SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase) layer growth
- Electrode particle cracking

### R² — Curve Quality Index

The coefficient of determination (R²) measures how well the 30 relaxation voltage samples fit the ideal logarithmic model `V(t) = A × ln(t) + B`.

**Centered regression for float precision:**
On 8-bit AVR (no FPU), 32-bit `float` has only 7 significant digits. Raw voltage values (~3.85V) cause catastrophic cancellation in the variance formula `S_yy = Σy² - (Σy)²/n` — two nearly equal large numbers subtracted, destroying all precision.

The fix: center the data by subtracting the first sample:
```
ΔV[i] = V[i] - V[0]     // range: 0.000 .. 0.010 V
```
Now `ΔV` values are small, and the variance calculation preserves all 7 digits of mantissa.

The regression is performed on:
- X-axis: `ln(t)` from PROGMEM constant array (pre-computed, no runtime `log()`)
- Y-axis: centered voltage `ΔV(t)`

A perfect fit gives R² = 1.0. Deviations indicate structural problems inside the cell.

## SOH Grading

| R² Value | Grade | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| > 0.999 | **EXCELLENT** | Perfect ion diffusion. No degradation detected. |
| 0.95 – 0.999 | **GOOD** | Minor aging. Possible contact oxidation or early SEI growth. |
| < 0.95 | **POOR** | Abnormal diffusion. Suspected micro-short circuit or severe electrode damage. |

**Note:** If the relaxation amplitude is below 4mV (quantization limit of ADS1115 at 187.5µV/LSB), R² is automatically set to 1.0 and graded as EXCELLENT. This prevents false negatives on high-quality batteries with very low polarization resistance.

### What Each Grade Means

**EXCELLENT (R² > 0.999)**
- Electrolyte is fresh and fully functional
- Electrode surfaces are clean and intact
- No parasitic self-discharge
- Battery can be trusted for critical applications

**GOOD (0.95 < R² < 0.999)**
- Normal aging for a used cell
- May have minor contact oxidation
- SEI layer has grown slightly but is still functional
- Suitable for most applications, monitor over time

**POOR (R² < 0.95)**
- Ion diffusion path is significantly disrupted
- Possible causes: micro-short, electrode particle fracture, electrolyte decomposition
- **Replace the battery** — do not use in critical applications

## Configuration

All user-tunable parameters are in `config.h`. Hardware-level constants (PGA gains, full-scale voltages, channel assignments, saturation threshold) are in `ads1115.h`.

### Hardware

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `VERSION` | `"1.0"` | Firmware version (displayed in banner) |
| `MOSFET_PIN` | `7` | Digital output for load switch |
| `ADS1115_ADDR` | `0x48` | I2C address (change if ADDR pin is HIGH) |
| `SHUNT_RESISTANCE` | `0.1` Ω | Current sense resistor value |
| `LOAD_RESISTANCE` | `10.0` Ω | Load resistor for discharge pulse |

### Measurement Timing

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `PULSE_DURATION_MS` | `200` ms | Duration of current pulse |
| `RELAX_SAMPLES` | `30` | Number of voltage samples during relaxation |
| `RELAX_SAMPLE_STEP_MS` | `10` ms | Time between relaxation samples |
| `PRE_PULSE_SETTLE_MS` | `50` ms | Settling time before first reading |
| `V_AFTER_SETTLE_MS` | `3` ms | Wait for first conversion after MOSFET off |
| `ADC_START_LEAD_MS` | `2` ms | Start conversion before target time (start-before-wait) |

### Safety Thresholds

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `BATTERY_MIN_V` | `2.5` V | Minimum allowed voltage |
| `BATTERY_MAX_V` | `4.3` V | Maximum allowed voltage (overvoltage protection) |
| `MAX_CURRENT_A` | `2.5` A | Maximum allowed current (limited by shunt + PGA) |
| `SAFETY_TIMEOUT_MS` | `2000` ms | Hard kill-switch for MOSFET (I2C hang protection) |
| `MIN_RELAX_MV` | `4.0` mV | Minimum relaxation amplitude for valid R² (quantization guard) |

### Choosing Load Resistor

The load resistor determines the discharge current. For a 3.7V Li-ion cell:

| Load Resistor | Approx. Current | Power Dissipated | Recommended? |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 5 Ω | 740 mA | 2.7 W | Only with heatsink |
| **10 Ω** | **370 mA** | **1.4 W** | **Yes (default)** |
| 20 Ω | 185 mA | 0.7 W | Yes |
| 47 Ω | 79 mA | 0.3 W | Conservative |

**Rule of thumb:** The current should be 0.2C–0.5C for the cell under test. For a typical 2500 mAh 18650, that's 500–1250 mA, so a 10 Ω resistor at ~370 mA is a safe conservative choice.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `UNDERVOLTAGE` message | Battery below 2.5V or not connected | Check wiring, charge battery |
| `OVERVOLTAGE` message | Battery above 4.3V | Disconnect immediately, check cell |
| `ADC SATURATED` error | Current exceeds 2.5A (shunt + PGA limit) | Use larger load resistor or lower-value shunt |
| `I2C bus fault` error | Wiring error, missing pull-ups, wrong address | Check SDA/SCL wiring, add 4.7kΩ pull-ups, verify ADDR pin |
| `Voltage left safe range` | Battery voltage drifted during measurement | Check battery connection, try fresh cell |
| R_ohm = 0 mΩ | Current too low to measure | Use smaller load resistor |
| R² very low (< 0.9) | Battery damaged or wrong timing | Check MOSFET switching, verify cell |
| Erratic readings | I2C noise, loose connections | Shorten wires, add 100nF cap on ADS1115 VDD |
| ADS1115 not responding | Wrong I2C address or wiring | Verify SDA/SCL connections, check ADDR pin |
| I2C bus lockup | Missing external pull-ups | Add 4.7kΩ pull-ups on SDA/SCL to 5V (internal pull-ups too weak for 200kHz) |

## Theory

### Why Logarithmic?

The voltage relaxation of a lithium-ion battery after current interruption follows from the solid-state diffusion equation in spherical electrode particles. The solution, valid for short times after perturbation, gives:

```
V(t) = V_ocv - (2RT / nF) × √(t / π) × (1/√(D_s) × ...)
```

For practical time windows (10–300 ms), this simplifies to the empirical logarithmic form:

```
V(t) = A × ln(t) + B
```

This relationship has been validated extensively in academic literature and is the basis for commercial battery characterization tools. The R² goodness-of-fit metric captures how closely a real battery follows this ideal behavior.

**Implementation note:** The `ln(t)` values are pre-computed at compile time and stored in AVR flash (PROGMEM) — 30 calls to `log()` on the ATmega328P would cost ~15ms of CPU time with no hardware FPU.

### Comparison to EIS

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) requires expensive equipment (frequency response analyzer + potentiostat, typically $5,000+). VRA achieves similar diagnostic insight with:
- **1/100th the cost** (ADS1115 ≈ $5 vs EIS equipment ≈ $5,000)
- **1/10th the time** (400ms vs minutes for full EIS sweep)
- **No frequency domain expertise** needed

The trade-off: VRA provides fewer data points than a full Nyquist plot, but for pass/fail grading and SOH estimation, it is sufficient.
