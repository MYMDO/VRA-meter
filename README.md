## Overview

Traditional battery testers rely on complex hardware — multiple current sources, precision amplifiers, dedicated fuel gauge ICs. This project flips the paradigm: **minimize the hardware, maximize the software intelligence**.

The ESR-VRA Meter uses **Voltage Relaxation Analysis** — the same technique used in advanced BMS systems for electric vehicles — to extract three critical battery health parameters from a single 200ms current pulse:

| Parameter | What It Measures | Equivalent To |
|-----------|-----------------|---------------|
| **R_ohm** | Instantaneous voltage jump on load disconnect | AC-IR at 1 kHz |
| **R_pol** | Slow voltage recovery after load removal | Diffusion/polarization resistance |
| **R²** | How well the relaxation curve fits a logarithmic model | Structural integrity of electrodes & electrolyte |

The entire measurement takes under 400ms and requires no user expertise — the firmware automatically grades the battery as **EXCELLENT**, **GOOD**, or **POOR**.

### Kelvin Connection

For accurate voltage measurement, use **4-wire Kelvin sensing**:

- **Sense wires (thin):** Connect A2 (V+) and A3 (V-) directly to the battery terminals
- **Power wires (thick):** Connect through the shunt and load for current path
- Keep sense wires as short as possible and away from power traces

```

### Key Design Decisions

- **Direct-port bit-banged I2C** — ATmega328P PORTC manipulation (`sdaHigh()`, `sclLow()`) achieves ~200kHz clock, vs ~20kHz with `digitalWrite`. No Wire library, no interrupt conflicts
- **Single-shot mode** (860 SPS) — one conversion per read, no continuous streaming overhead
- **No external libraries** — pure Arduino core, zero `#include` beyond `<Arduino.h>` and `<math.h>`
- **All config in one file** — every tunable parameter lives in `config.h`
- **PROGMEM log table** — pre-computed `ln(10)..ln(300)` in flash, avoiding 30 expensive `log()` calls on the FPU-less ATmega328P
- **Centered regression** — voltage data is centered (`ΔV = V[i] - V[0]`) before R² calculation to prevent catastrophic cancellation in 32-bit float
- **Zero-delay V_instant** — no software delay after MOSFET off; the ADS1115's 1.16ms integration window naturally filters inductive ringing
- **Start-before-wait ADC timing** — conversion starts ~2ms before target read time, runs in parallel with the busy-wait, ensuring samples are precisely aligned to the 10ms grid

### Commands

| Key | Action |
|-----|--------|
| Any character | Run one measurement |
| `a` / `A` | Toggle auto-mode (continuous measurements every 1 second) |

### Auto Mode

In auto-mode, the device continuously measures and outputs results. This is useful for:
- Monitoring voltage drift over time
- Logging relaxation curves to a file
- Testing battery response to repeated pulses

## Measurement Science

### Voltage Relaxation Curve

When a lithium-ion battery delivers current and the load is suddenly removed, the terminal voltage does not recover instantly. Instead, it follows a characteristic two-phase recovery:

**Phase 1 — Ohmic Recovery (instantaneous):**
The voltage jumps by `I × R_ohm` the moment current stops. This reflects the purely resistive losses in the metal contacts, electrolyte, and separator.

**Phase 2 — Chemical Relaxation (logarithmic):**
The voltage continues to rise slowly as lithium ions diffuse back to equilibrium positions within the electrode crystal structure. This process follows `V(t) = A × ln(t) + B` where `t` is time after load removal.

Healthy batteries follow this logarithmic law precisely. Degraded batteries deviate from it.

### R_ohm — Ohmic Resistance

Calculated from the instantaneous voltage jump when load is disconnected:

```
R_ohm = (V_instant - V_load) / I_load
```

This is equivalent to the AC internal resistance measured at 1 kHz by professional impedance analyzers, but obtained with a simple DC pulse.

**Typical values for 18650 Li-ion cells:**
- New cell: 20–50 mΩ
- Aged cell: 50–150 mΩ
- Damaged cell: > 200 mΩ

### R_pol — Polarization Resistance

Calculated from the total voltage relaxation depth:

```
R_pol = (V_final - V_instant) / I_load
```

This represents the combined resistance of charge transfer at the electrode surfaces and solid-state diffusion of lithium ions. It is highly sensitive to:
- Electrolyte decomposition
- SEI (Solid Electrolyte Interphase) layer growth
- Electrode particle cracking

### R² — Curve Quality Index

The coefficient of determination (R²) measures how well the 30 relaxation voltage samples fit the ideal logarithmic model `V(t) = A × ln(t) + B`.

**Centered regression for float precision:**
On 8-bit AVR (no FPU), 32-bit `float` has only 7 significant digits. Raw voltage values (~3.85V) cause catastrophic cancellation in the variance formula `S_yy = Σy² - (Σy)²/n` — two nearly equal large numbers subtracted, destroying all precision.

The fix: center the data by subtracting the first sample:
```
ΔV[i] = V[i] - V[0]     // range: 0.000 .. 0.010 V
```
Now `ΔV` values are small, and the variance calculation preserves all 7 digits of mantissa.

The regression is performed on:
- X-axis: `ln(t)` from PROGMEM constant array (pre-computed, no runtime `log()`)
- Y-axis: centered voltage `ΔV(t)`

A perfect fit gives R² = 1.0. Deviations indicate structural problems inside the cell.

## SOH Grading

| R² Value | Grade | Interpretation |
|----------|-------|----------------|
| > 0.999 | **EXCELLENT** | Perfect ion diffusion. No degradation detected. |
| 0.95 – 0.999 | **GOOD** | Minor aging. Possible contact oxidation or early SEI growth. |
| < 0.95 | **POOR** | Abnormal diffusion. Suspected micro-short circuit or severe electrode damage. |

### What Each Grade Means

**EXCELLENT (R² > 0.999)**
- Electrolyte is fresh and fully functional
- Electrode surfaces are clean and intact
- No parasitic self-discharge
- Battery can be trusted for critical applications

**GOOD (0.95 < R² < 0.999)**
- Normal aging for a used cell
- May have minor contact oxidation
- SEI layer has grown slightly but is still functional
- Suitable for most applications, monitor over time

**POOR (R² < 0.95)**
- Ion diffusion path is significantly disrupted
- Possible causes: micro-short, electrode particle fracture, electrolyte decomposition
- **Replace the battery** — do not use in critical applications

## Configuration

All parameters are in `config.h`:

### Hardware

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `MOSFET_PIN` | `7` | Digital output for load switch |
| `ADS1115_ADDR` | `0x48` | I2C address (change if ADDR pin is HIGH) |
| `SHUNT_RESISTANCE` | `0.1` Ω | Current sense resistor value |
| `LOAD_RESISTANCE` | `10.0` Ω | Load resistor for discharge pulse |

### Measurement Timing

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `PULSE_DURATION_MS` | `200` ms | Duration of current pulse |
| `RELAX_SAMPLES` | `30` | Number of voltage samples during relaxation |
| `RELAX_SAMPLE_STEP_MS` | `10` ms | Time between relaxation samples |
| `PRE_PULSE_SETTLE_MS` | `50` ms | Settling time before first reading |

### Safety Thresholds

| Parameter | Default | Description |
|-----------|---------|-------------|
| `BATTERY_MIN_V` | `2.5` V | Minimum allowed voltage |
| `BATTERY_MAX_V` | `4.3` V | Maximum allowed voltage (overvoltage protection) |
| `MAX_CURRENT_A` | `5.0` A | Maximum allowed current |

### Choosing Load Resistor

The load resistor determines the discharge current. For a 3.7V Li-ion cell:

| Load Resistor | Approx. Current | Power Dissipated | Recommended? |
|---------------|-----------------|-------------------|--------------|
| 5 Ω | 740 mA | 2.7 W | Only with heatsink |
| **10 Ω** | **370 mA** | **1.4 W** | **Yes (default)** |
| 20 Ω | 185 mA | 0.7 W | Yes |
| 47 Ω | 79 mA | 0.3 W | Conservative |

**Rule of thumb:** The current should be 0.2C–0.5C for the cell under test. For a typical 2500 mAh 18650, that's 500–1250 mA, so a 10 Ω resistor at ~370 mA is a safe conservative choice.

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely Cause | Solution |
|---------|-------------|----------|
| `UNDERVOLTAGE` message | Battery below 2.5V or not connected | Check wiring, charge battery |
| `OVERVOLTAGE` message | Battery above 4.3V | Disconnect immediately, check cell |
| R_ohm = 0 mΩ | Current too low to measure | Use smaller load resistor |
| R_ohm too low / R_pol too high | Software delay before V_instant | Verify no delay between MOSFET off and first ADC read (fixed in firmware) |
| R² very low (< 0.9) | Battery damaged or wrong timing | Check MOSFET switching, verify cell |
| Erratic readings | I2C noise, loose connections | Shorten wires, add 100nF cap on ADS1115 VDD |
| ADS1115 not responding | Wrong I2C address or wiring | Verify SDA/SCL connections, check ADDR pin |

## Theory

### Why Logarithmic?

The voltage relaxation of a lithium-ion battery after current interruption follows from the solid-state diffusion equation in spherical electrode particles. The solution, valid for short times after perturbation, gives:

```
V(t) = V_ocv - (2RT / nF) × √(t / π) × (1/√(D_s) × ...)
```

For practical time windows (10–300 ms), this simplifies to the empirical logarithmic form:

```
V(t) = A × ln(t) + B
```

This relationship has been validated extensively in academic literature and is the basis for commercial battery characterization tools. The R² goodness-of-fit metric captures how closely a real battery follows this ideal behavior.

**Implementation note:** The `ln(t)` values are pre-computed at compile time and stored in AVR flash (PROGMEM) — 30 calls to `log()` on the ATmega328P would cost ~15ms of CPU time with no hardware FPU.

### Comparison to EIS

Electrochemical Impedance Spectroscopy (EIS) requires expensive equipment (frequency response analyzer + potentiostat, typically $5,000+). VRA achieves similar diagnostic insight with:
- **1/100th the cost** (ADS1115 ≈ $5 vs EIS equipment ≈ $5,000)
- **1/10th the time** (400ms vs minutes for full EIS sweep)
- **No frequency domain expertise** needed

The trade-off: VRA provides fewer data points than a full Nyquist plot, but for pass/fail grading and SOH estimation, it is sufficient.
